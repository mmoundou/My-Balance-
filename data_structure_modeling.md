Data structure 
Data elements or attributes 
Instances or columns 
Tables or objects     
Why do we map objects as tables? 
relationship between tables (primary key and foreign keys) 
Normalize table

Determine indexes 

Is the database easily updatable? 

Data elements that appear in one or more tables 
Understanding the niche
compsite key 
How to code for individuation 
linking tablee

Why do we organize data in tables? 
What is the significance of a key? 
Why do we differentiate between keys and indexes? 

create new tables create new relationships create more of what? 

modeling real world entities
identifying instances of each entity (to allow retrieval, for one)

data elements allow individuation and might also store values that can allow each instance to perform an operation 

It's a paradigm
